            We would like to thank you for providing hospitality and amenities that made our experience and stay here exceed our expectations. It was our perfect post-tax season romantic retreat (I am a tax accountant.) God bless and keep up the awesome job.

            Thank you for a wonderful stay. We plan on coming back whenever in Indy. You made us feel at home and we plan to spread the word to anyone coming this way.

            Thank you for a memorable anniversary! The room was beautiful, the breakfast delicious and the hospitality like none we had ever experienced. We very much enjoyed the cookies, comfy bed and Jacuzzi. Can’t wait for our next visit!
